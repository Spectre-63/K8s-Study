Features:
  Package Manager for Kubernetes
    Collections of YAML files
    Create your own Helm Charts with Helm
    Push to Helm repo
    Download and use existing ones

  Quick deploy option to deploy standard apps

  Private registries also exist

  Templating Engine
    allows you to create a common blueprint and replace dynamic values within
    the yaml with placeholders
    {{ .Values.container.name}}

  Effective for multi-platform environment clusters


typical Structure:

mychart /  < - Chart name
  Chart.Yaml  < - meta info about chart (name, version, dependencies, etc)
  values.yaml < - default values for template files
  charts/ < - chart dependencies
  templates/ < - storage for template files

Value injection into template files:

values.yaml:
imageName: myapp
port: 8080
version: 1.0.0

my-values.yaml:
version 2.0.0

resulting yaml set:
imageName: myapp
port: 8080
version: 2.0.0

you can also use --set to define the values at runtime

Release Management:

v2: two parts: client (helm CLI)/server (Tiller)
  Tiller provides a record of all chart executions, and applies the changes
  to the existing deployment, instead of creating a new one

  also provides rollback functionality

  Downside: Tiller has too much power inside of K8s cluster, resulting in
  security issues
v3: DOES NOT INCLUDE TILLER
